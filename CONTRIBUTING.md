We welcome contributions of code and documentation that are specific
to HelioSwarm. Please understand that we are currently focussed on
mission design and planning. Our capacity to review and incorporate
contributions is therefore limited.

For most questions and conversation, please open a
[discussion](https://github.com/helioswarm/helioswarm/discussions). This
includes potential but unverified bugs, support with your use case, or
general less-structured help. From these discussions the HelioSwarm
team can assist in formalizing issues as appropriate.

If you are pretty sure something is a bug or have a fully-formulated
feature request, feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/helioswarm/helioswarm/issues).

To submit changes to code or documentation, open a [pull
request](https://github.com/helioswarm/helioswarm/pulls).
