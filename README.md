Code and examples specific to the HelioSwarm mission.

This repository hosts public code for the
[HelioSwarm](https://eos.unh.edu/helioswarm) mission, currently in
Phase B. Contributions from the team and community are welcome.

Due to the early stage of the mission, the contents, organization, and
rules of this repository are subject to change. Please bear with us as
we practice [open
science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) principles
in the mission space.

## About the Phase B Reference Design
The HelioSwarm Flight Dynamics team prepares representative trajectories
for use in mission planning. As these can be useful for developing
analysis techniques, the HelioSwarm team provides these to the
community. They are provided in the form of summary files which will
eventually evolve to be similar to a product planned during science
operations; however, both the contents and the details of the format
are preliminary!

The exact configurations will change rapidly; in particular, the
representative trajectories do not represent a prediction of actual positions
during the mision.

If you use these configurations for any analysis, please make note of
the file version number and the corresponding reference
design. Current version 0.2.0 of the summary files uses Swarm
Reference Design 5B, Flight System Transfer Trajectory 0x75b, dated
2024-06-24.

Most other details of the file format are in the CDF attributes.
